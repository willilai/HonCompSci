This program creates a website that has information about blue whales. It has a link to a Youtube video with information about blue whales, a table that compares the size of blue whales to other whale species, an Ifram that has a website with info about blue whales, and a button that shows a picture of what blue whales eat. 

My advanced HTML aspect is the Questionnaire. I used JavaScript to change the color of the button when the user clicks the correct one and if they click the wrong one. 

The commit with my final HTML is: 54b5abdfa7bfae1df2b483db2d7ddaa5b7aa1dc0.
